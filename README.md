# School District Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
The main purpose of this analysis is to see which factor benefit the most the schools in the district. The factors that were evaluated include funding, size, school type, and some others and we analysed the way this factor influence the scores for a standardized test for reading and math. Then we had to take into account that some of the data set had been comprimised so we cleaned it and streamlined it to exctract better results from the data set.

## Results

In this first summary we can see that the number of passing students in both subjets falled due to the misinformation in the original data set

In the new data set we can see that since the bad data was only a small subsection of the whole school, Thomas Highschool doesn't see enough of a drop in average score tu lower them a rank, but a lower passing average is still noticible.

### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following
#### Math and reading scores by grade

It also went down but not by as drastic as with math.

As expected the other grades dont change.

#### Scores by school spending, school size & school type

The same can be said for all of these, the categories where THS was a part of went down, and the ones that it wasnt weren't affected.


## Summary
In the bigger picture this new data gave us significat changes for the statistics were THB was present, but they were not drastic enough for the ranking of the school to change.
